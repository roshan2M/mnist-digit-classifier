# mnist-digit-classifier

My initial attempt at using Keras to create a handwritten Digit Classifier. I followed a tutorial from https://machinelearningmastery.com/, learning about convolution neural networks and how easy it is to implement them in Keras. Furthermore, this is helping me research how to use Keras for UW Sailbot. The main challenge I have to tackle is learning how to create an Image Classifier, since our sailboat needs to recognize a distinct, orange buoy in the water. Some of the challenges include making the classifier, preprocessing the inputs for the classifier, and training the classifier on a variety of images.
